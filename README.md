# cpu_scheduling- Project Title: Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator

Description:
This project is a web-based CPU scheduling simulator that supports First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin (Quantum = 3) scheduling algorithms. Users can input process details, run the selected algorithm, and view results in a structured table format. The simulator also calculates key performance metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and response time to help understand the efficiency of different scheduling techniques.

Features:
âœ… Supports three CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin)
âœ… Interactive user input form for process details
âœ… Dynamic table output displaying computed scheduling results
âœ… Performance analysis with key metrics (waiting time, turnaround time)
âœ… Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless experience

Future Enhancements:
ðŸ”¹ Add Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
ðŸ”¹ Implement Gantt chart visualization for better clarity
ðŸ”¹ Allow dynamic quantum input for Round Robin scheduling
ðŸ”¹ Improve UI responsiveness and user experience

Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Libraries: JavaScript DOM Manipulation

Version Control: GitHub
